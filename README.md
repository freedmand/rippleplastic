## Running locally

To build Ripple Plastic on your own machine, you will need to have NodeJS installed.

After cloning the repository, install the NPM dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

The project can be built by running

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will compile the assets and serve the project on localhost (usually http://localhost:5000). Modifying the source should dynamically rebuild the project.
